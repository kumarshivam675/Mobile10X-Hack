        Introduction
        ------------
        
        ``virtualenv`` is a tool to create isolated Python environments.
        
        The basic problem being addressed is one of dependencies and versions,
        and indirectly permissions. Imagine you have an application that
        needs version 1 of LibFoo, but another application requires version
        2. How can you use both these applications?  If you install
        everything into ``/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages`` (or whatever your
        platform's standard location is), it's easy to end up in a situation
        where you unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn't be
        upgraded.
        
        Or more generally, what if you want to install an application *and
        leave it be*?  If an application works, any change in its libraries or
        the versions of those libraries can break the application.
        
        Also, what if you can't install packages into the global
        ``site-packages`` directory?  For instance, on a shared host.
        
        In all these cases, ``virtualenv`` can help you. It creates an
        environment that has its own installation directories, that doesn't
        share libraries with other virtualenv environments (and optionally
        doesn't access the globally installed libraries either).
